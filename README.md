# RFC Monitor

A decentralized platform for tracking, reviewing, and incentivizing Request for Comments (RFC) proposals on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

RFC Monitor is a blockchain-native platform designed to facilitate the collaborative development and review of technical proposals. By leveraging Clarity smart contracts, we create a transparent, decentralized system for managing RFC submissions, reviews, and bounties.

## Core Features

- **RFC Proposal Tracking**: Submit, track, and manage technical proposals
- **Decentralized Review System**: Incentivize and reward high-quality technical reviews
- **Transparent Bounty Mechanism**: Enable direct financial rewards for meaningful contributions
- **Immutable Proposal History**: Maintain a permanent, auditable record of all proposals and reviews

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform consists of a single smart contract that manages the entire RFC lifecycle:

### RFC Monitoring Contract (`rfc-monitoring`)
- Handles proposal creation and submission
- Manages review process and bounty distribution
- Tracks proposal status (draft, review, accepted, rejected)
- Implements secure payment mechanisms
- Provides transparent platform fee tracking

## Key Functions

### Proposal Management
```clarity
;; Create a new RFC proposal
(create-proposal 
  (title (string-ascii 100)) 
  (description (string-utf8 1000)) 
  (bounty uint)
)

;; Submit a review for a proposal
(submit-review 
  (proposal-id uint) 
  (feedback (string-utf8 2000)) 
  (rating uint)
)

;; Complete a review and release bounty
(complete-review (review-id uint))
```

### Platform Management
```clarity
;; Withdraw accumulated platform fees
(withdraw-platform-earnings (amount uint))

;; Get platform earnings
(get-platform-earnings)
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Clarinet for Clarity smart contract development
3. Deploy the contract to Stacks blockchain
4. Interact with the contract using provided functions

## Security Considerations

- All monetary transactions use secure transfer mechanisms
- Platform fees are transparently calculated and tracked
- Review and proposal statuses have strict validation
- Admin functions are access-controlled
- Bounty distribution is governed by smart contract logic

## Economic Model

- 5% platform fee on all bounties
- Minimum proposal bounty: 1 STX
- Minimum review bounty: 0.5 STX
- Supports flexible bounty amounts to incentivize quality contributions

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit proposals, reviews, and improvements to help evolve the platform.
